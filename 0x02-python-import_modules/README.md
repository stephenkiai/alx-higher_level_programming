## Python import modules
```
In Python, modules are files that contain Python definitions and statements.
The import statement is used to import a module and make its contents available
for use in a program. You can also use the from statement to import specific
objects from a module or rename a module or object using the as keyword. Python
comes with a large number of built-in modules that can be imported and used in
a program, and you can also create your own custom modules. Importing modules
is a fundamental concept in Python programming that helps you organize your code,
maintain and reuse it, and take advantage of existing code libraries.
