Higher level programming languages such as Python, SQL, and
Javascript are designed to make programming easier and more

Python is a popular language used for web development, scientific
computing, data analysis, and AI. With its simple syntax and large
standard library, Python makes it easy to write clean, maintainable,

tables.
